**Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data**

This project analyzes and visualizes sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. Using Python libraries such as pandas for data handling, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and natural language processing tools for sentiment analysis, it identifies trends and insights from large volumes of text data. The visualizations include sentiment distribution charts, time-based sentiment trends, and comparisons across different topics or brands, helping businesses and researchers gauge public mood and make informed decisions.
